ISSUES I HAD ALONG THE WAY

-Commenting on posts

    I used a guide to help me add comments to blog posts, the code conflicted with my code. 
    it was very hard to style the comments and allow the comments to show up properly. 

-Nav bar stick

    Nav bars position was set to stick. I had to do some CSS to get the background image to be the right size and not move when you scroll on the page. This made my Nav bar only have the stick position for one full scroll, where the background image was cute off before. Nav bar is set to a z-index of 999 and i still am working on getting the nav bar to hold the stick position as you scroll.
